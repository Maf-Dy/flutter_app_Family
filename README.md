# Family Game App

A Flutter application for a family game with LAN multiplayer support. Made with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).

## Description

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application that allows players to enter their names and join the game. It includes a simple dart http server that serves a simple html. The game idea is based on a popular guessing game where each player enters their name based on a pre-determined category, and players take turns asking questions to guess the name of the other players. The last player not guessed wins.

Please note that the project is still under development and not ready for production.

## Getting Started

To run the app:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies.
3. Run `flutter run` to start the app.
